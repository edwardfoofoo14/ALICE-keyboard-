This is my SELENE, my project for the Blueprint Hack Club event!
The board itself is using an ALICE layout but with added F rows, it is inspired by Dante from Devil May Cry (cus hes my favourite). It uses a stacked acrylic format which I took inspiration from Adelheid, and Arisu which are both Alice keyboards. The stacked acrylic mentioned is a collection of 10, 3mm, A# sized, machine cut acrylic plates screwed together, I chose this method in particular because the material will generate a "clackier" sound profile and is also more cost effective that other methods.


Please find attached the following, pcb, plate and case.

PCB:
Note: it is quite rudimentary because a keyboard isn't the most complicated thing in the world.

Also linked are the schematics, the image doesn't show the full thing because most of it is the same. The images captures a little bit of everything with LED components at the top, Switches in the bottom right and power management on the left.

Plate:
Note: its going to be shinier in real life :D

Note: My plate and case are both in dxf forms and I may still shift things around as I see fit. Also, don't use the .json from the pcb to generate a plate it will not work, use the attached plate.dxf instead.

To assemble the keyboard the items required are
-10xA3 acrylic boards (3mm)
-1xA3 acrylic board (2mm)
-Poron gaskets(3mm thickness)
-6x each of M5, 35mm screws & M5 nuts 

Use the dxfs in the dxf folder
Cut the 10 3mm boards from plate 1 to plate 10

Cut the 2mm board for the main plate

To assemble, place each numbered board from the bottom up. E.g. plate 1 is stacked first followed by plate and so on.
By the second plate, secure the daughterboard and add the poron gaskets to the spaces that stick out. After that, place the keyboard plate on top with the pcb attached.
Repeat the sticking of poron gaskets but this time on the top surface. Continue layering from plate 3-10.

To secure the board, use the screws to skewer the whole thing, ideally with the nuts on the bottom side.

An important thing to note would be to afix your stabilisers switches to the plate and PCB before assembly as there is nothing to join the pcb and plate together.
Also for plate 2 and 10 there are my personal designs, you can add your own if you want or just make sure you remove it if you don't want my design.
