This is my keyboard project for the Blueprint Hack Club event!
Please find attached the following, pcb, plate and case.
The board itself is using an ALICE layout but with added F rows, it is inspired by Dante from Devil May Cry (cus hes my favourite). It uses a stacked acrylic format which I took inspiration from Adelheid, another Alice keyboard.

Note: My plate and case are both in dxf forms and I may still shift things around as I see fit. Also, don't use the .json from the pcb to generate a plate it will not work, use the attached plate.dxf instead.
