To assemble the keyboard the items required are
-10xA3 acrylic boards (3mm)
-1xA3 acrylic board (2mm)
-Poron gaskets(3mm thickness)
-6x each of M5, 35mm screws & M5 nuts 

Use the dxfs in the dxf folder
Cut the 10 3mm boards from plate 1 to plate 10

Cut the 2mm board for the main plate

To assemble, place each numbered board from the bottom up. E.g. plate 1 is stacked first followed by plate  and so on.
By the second plate, secure the daughterboard and add the poron gaskets to the spaces that stick out. After that, place the keyboard plate on top with the pcb attached.
Repeat the sticking of poron gaskets but this time on the top surface. Continue layering from plate 3-10.

To secure the board, use the screws to skewer the whole thing, ideally with the nuts on the bottom side.

An important thing to note would be to afix your stabilisers switches to the plate and PCB before assembly as there is nothing to join the pcb and plate together.
Also for plate 2 and 10 there are my personal designs, you can add your own if you want or just make sure you remove it if you don't want my design.
