This is my journal of the design and building process of **ALICE keyboard**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/743).


## 10/19/2025 - started my journey!  

It is currenly 8:40pm 19/10/2025, I have started making the concept to my keyboard and plan to fully deep dive into this project starting tomorrow. 

I have also done the following
-install CAD
-learned rerouting PCBS
-decided on the ALICE LAYOUT
-done some research on the components needed

## 10/20/2025 - Day 1 : General outline done  

Had some free time after running and drafted out the first schematic! 

I've decided to commit to the 75% format as well as the ALICE I had originally intended, the build will be plastic milled (hopefully) and will feature LED (compatible under VIA) and have hot-swap sockets to make it convenient to modify in the future. It will also be gasket mounted to eliminate possible damage to the PCB through contact with screws.

The proudest feature would definitely have to be the K N O B. All hail the K N O B.

As for the specifications it hasn't been CADed so it'll be in the ballpark of my Keychron V1 MAX of 
40cm x 20cm x 5cm

note: i don't think i will include bluetooth and a battery because it is too complex for a beginner such as I. Tomorrow I shall CAD and try to design a PCB for it
