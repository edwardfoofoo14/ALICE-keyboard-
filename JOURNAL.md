## 10/19/2025 - started my journey!  

It is currenly 8:40pm 19/10/2025, I have started making the concept to my keyboard and plan to fully deep dive into this project starting tomorrow. 

I have also done the following
-install CAD
-learned rerouting PCBS
-decided on the ALICE LAYOUT
-done some research on the components needed

## 10/20/2025 - Day 1 : General outline done  

Had some free time after running and drafted out the first schematic! 

I've decided to commit to the 75% format as well as the ALICE I had originally intended, the build will be plastic milled (hopefully) and will feature LED (compatible under VIA) and have hot-swap sockets to make it convenient to modify in the future. It will also be gasket mounted to eliminate possible damage to the PCB through contact with screws.

The proudest feature would definitely have to be the K N O B. All hail the K N O B.

As for the specifications it hasn't been CADed so it'll be in the ballpark of my Keychron V1 MAX of 
40cm x 20cm x 5cm

note: i don't think i will include bluetooth and a battery because it is too complex for a beginner such as I. Tomorrow I shall CAD and try to design a PCB for it

## 10/21/2025 - Day 2 : finished the schematics  

After checking, double checking, and triple checking, it works!

This took a long time because this was my first time making pcbs, I had to look up countless guides, youtube videos, and various materials, huge thanks to the FateNozomi (creator of the Arisu) for making the files public and also MrKeebs who let me mess around with KLE. At the end of the day the schematics features a relatively simple design with 84 switches and LEDS.

Note: I was struggling like a buffoon before I asked for help from my friend Anson at hour 6 so thanks to him too for helping with the power components!


With that day 2 is done and I shall make the actual PCB tomorrow.

## 10/23/2025 - Day 3: Finished the rough outline of the PCB  

There were a few kinks to knock out from the previous day, but the main issue for today was getting used to the PCB editor on Kicad, I spent around 1 hour just having a nervous breakdown on why my components aren't lying on the grid, and because of the weird tilt that half the keyboard has there were lots of intersections that didnt look the nicest.
